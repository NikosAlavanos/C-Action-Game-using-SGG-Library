## **Overview**

Alien 3 Level 1 Recreation is our homage to the classic action game "Alien 3" on the Sega Genesis. This project focuses on recreating the first level of the game using similar sprites and design elements to showcase effective game development techniques. The project incorporates authentic sound effects and music inspired by various Alien franchise games and movies, creating an immersive and nostalgic atmosphere.

## **Key Features**

- **Authentic Visuals:**  
  Recreates the look and feel of the original Alien 3 first level using carefully designed sprites and level layouts.

- **Classic Soundtrack:**  
  Features sounds and music inspired by the Alien franchise, enhancing the overall ambiance and delivering an authentic gaming experience.

- **Gameplay Mechanics:**  
  Demonstrates key gameplay elements from the original game, including enemy behaviors, level navigation, and player interactions.

- **Educational Focus:**  
  Serves as a practical example of game development techniques, emphasizing sprite manipulation, level design, and sound integration.

## **How to Play**

1. **Movement:**  
   - Use the arrow keys (or designated movement keys) to navigate your character through the level.
   
2. **Shooting:**  
   - Press the designated action key (e.g., "Z" or "X") to fire your weapon at enemies.
   
3. **Objective:**  
   - Progress through the level by overcoming obstacles and defeating alien enemies.
   - Watch out for environmental hazards and enemy attacks that can end your run.

   - Press the "P" key to pause the game if you need to take a break or review your strategy.

## **How to Use**

1. **Setup:**  
   - Compile the project using your preferred C++ compiler with the Simple Graphics Library (SGG) properly integrated.
   - Ensure that all required assets (sprites, sound files) are placed in the designated asset directories.

2. **Running the Game:**  
   - Execute the compiled binary to launch the game.
   - Navigate through the first level, experiencing the gameplay mechanics and atmospheric design reminiscent of the original Alien 3.

3. **Exploration:**  
   - Experiment with the recreated level to understand the design decisions and techniques used in the project.
   - Analyze the code to gain insights into game loop management, collision detection, and multimedia integration.

## **Technologies Used**

- **C++:** Primary programming language used for game development.
- **Simple Graphics Library (SGG):** Used exclusively for handling window management, graphics rendering, keyboard/mouse input, and audio playback.
- **Custom Game Engine Techniques:** Implements basic game loop, collision detection, and asset management to recreate the game environment.
